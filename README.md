# Fusematic 3D Printer

It's awesome, [buy one](http://store.makerstoolworks.com/printers-kits/fusematic-3d-printer/). Seriously. Right now. Anything even remotely close to the price range is a rattle trap.



## Modified Z Isolation

The modification includes a new Z endstop, a new isolator, and an optional 'foot' for the adjustment screw.
In order to use this, the delrin nut will have to be turned so that the flange faces downwards.
